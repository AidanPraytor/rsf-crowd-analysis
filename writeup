Data Storage:
    - Table 1, All Pulls:
        - Stores date, time, and percent full
    - New file created in data folder for every day.
        - Data is written to a file for its own day and the allPulls file


Control:
    - Pulls data every 10 minutes of every hour the RSF is open.
    - First approach:
        - Check if RSF is open (or should be) every 10 minutes of the 24 hour day
    - Second approach:
        - Find when RSF will open the next day and sleep until then.
        - Set a predetermined number of iterations of pulls every 10 minutes based on how many hours the RSF will
          be open that day.
        - After iteration, repeat.
        - Cons: Compounding time error
    - Third approach:
        - Some kind of clock object that wakes and runs the program at predetermined times depending on the day of
          the week (hours of operation)
        - I like this the best so far.
    - Fourth (simplified) approach:
        - Get current day
        - If before opening time of that day (current datetime - open datetime = - td):
            - Wait until open
        - If within current hours:
            - pull_and_write(now)
            - sleep for predetermined interval
        - If after closing time of that day (current datetime - close datetime = + td > close datetime - open datetime):
            - Get next day
            - Wait until next day open


    - Second approach breakdown:
        - Get current day, time and next day
        - If not within open hours of today, wait until open next day
        - If within open hours today:
            - If minute is an even interval (decided by pullsPerHour):
                - nextMinuteMark = currentMinute + round(60 / pullsPerHour)
                - if nextMinuteMark = 60: nextMinuteMark = 0
                - pull_and_write(now)
            - Get new datetime object to account for program time
            - determine how many seconds from new datetime until next even minute interval
            - wait that many seconds


        - Get current day and next day
        - If outside open hours: wait until next day open with timedelta
        - If within open hours:
            - If even minute interval:
                - Pull and write
                - Wait until next interval
            - If not on even minute interval:
                - Wait until next interval
